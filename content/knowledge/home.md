Due to the war on people who use drugs, much of the knowledge and terminology around drug use and harm reduction has become stigmatized knowledge, and can feel wrong or immoral to research and understand. Know that this is a product of decades of propaganda and purposefully-created stigma, and you are not alone in this. If you want to know more, these pages can help to fill you in.

If you're new to the concept of harm reduction, it might be helpful to check out [What is Harm Reduction?](/knowledge/harm-reduction-intro) for a quick intro to the philosophy, method, and terminology behind our practice. If you'd like to dive deeper into the politics surrounding the Drug War, and its effects on PWUD, [about the Drug War](/knowledge/drug-war) might be an excellent place to start.

We also have an introduction to the [compassionate use of naloxone](/knowledge/naloxone)/Narcan as an opioid overdose reversal tool and guides to [safer smoking](/knowledge/safer-smoking) and [safer injection](/knowledge/safer-injection).
