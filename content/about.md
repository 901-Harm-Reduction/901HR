901 Harm Reduction is a harm reduction group based in Memphis, Tennessee!

We provide services aimed at increasing safety for people in general, but especially people who use drugs here in Memphis.

### Services

Currently, 901 HR provides:
#### opioid overdose reversal kits
These are kits containing the life-saving medicine naloxone (also known by its brand name, Narcan.) This is the medicine that reverses opioid overdose and can save the life of a person who uses drugs. We distribute these for free [every Saturday](/posts/events), and provide training in their use for anyone who wants it. We also have a short post about its use [here.](/posts/od-reversal-how-to/)

#### sexual health supplies
We distribute condoms, lube, Plan B, pads and tampons.

#### fentaynl test strips
Due to the increase in fentanyl in local drug supplies, we provide testing kits to help people who use drugs have the most information they can about the drugs they intend to use. Knowledge of the presence of fentanyl in one's supply can save lives.esources and tools, and a safe space to communicate and empower our community of people who use drugs (PWUD)!

#### access to other organizations
Currently, we partner with Memphis Food Not Bombs and the Democratic Socialists of America Memphis chapter in order to distribute food and clothing at our picnics as well. These two mutual aid groups are aligned with our intention to build strong relationships with the unhoused community.
