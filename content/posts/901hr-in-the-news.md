title: 'Harm Reduction in the Face of Repression'
---

[Filter](https://filtermag.org/memphis-trump-harm-reduction/) recently covered our harm reduction strategy in the face of the Trump administration, and the information bears repeating as repression and deployments increase entering the new year.

> The deployment of the National Guard to Memphis is not to "combat crime," as the administration says. It is part of a far-ranging campaign to support the harassment, detention, and murder committed by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security across the country. The most vulnerable- the unhoused and undocumented- are subject to constant theft, harassment, and intimidation by people in camouflage uniforms. We have heard many, many stories of stolen supplies and relocation sweeps in the past few months, and anticipate further increases in repressive tactics deployed against our neighbors, comrades, and loved ones.

MPD, ICE, and the National Guard are organs of the same instinct- namely, to crush, imprison, exploit and dominate the most vulnerable among us. They can and will use vague pretexts ('public intoxication,' 'disorderly conduct,' 'loitering') to justify the detention and arrest of those who don't have a roof over their heads when they sleep, or a place to go when they need to unwind. These arrests are discriminatory and can be challenged in court, but the victim still suffers the indignity and torture of arrest, confinement, and record in the meantime.

If you find yourself interacting with the National Guard, federal agents, police, or an
immigration officer (ICE), remember that...

## YOU SHOULD:
> * Remain calm and keep your hands where the officer can see them.
> * If you’re stopped, ask: “Am I free to leave?” If yes, walk away calmly.
> * If detained, say: “I want to speak with a lawyer,” and stay silent.
> * You only need to give your name and address (if known) under Tennessee law.

## YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO:
> * If officers say you are not free to leave, you have the right to ask why (they must
have reasonable suspicion to detain you).

## YOU SHOULD NOT:
> * You have the right to not share your citizenship or immigration status.
> * If you have an “ID” from The HUB, that is NOT a real/standard ID. It is made
specifically for unhoused people. DO NOT wear it visibly to prevent the risk of targeting.
> * DO NOT sign anything you don’t understand. State “you wish to speak with an attorney.”
> * Don’t rely on the Union Mission or The HUB for protection — multiple reports show they
have called police on unhoused people with warrants upon presenting ID/legal name.

## USING TENTS WHILE UNHOUSED IS ILLEGAL IN MEMPHIS:
> * Tennessee law makes camping on public property a felony.
> * This includes tents, tarps, or shelters in parks, under bridges, or on sidewalks.
> * Violations can lead to up to six years in prison and fines.
> * If possible, avoid setting up visible structures and stay in groups for safety.
