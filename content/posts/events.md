## Calendar

### Picnics
We distribute opioid overdose reversal kits and safer smoking supplies every Saturday at Court Square Park in downtown Memphis at the picnic held by our partner program, Food Not Bombs. We set up at 1:30, and leave around 3 (Whenever MFNB's food runs out). (This event [has been covered by ABC24!](https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/food-not-bombs-event/522-6ea9efc1-3257-4a6d-9378-1e354f93f755))

### Syringe Service Program
We operate a syringe service program nearby on the same day, at Light Of Glory International Church, where we distribute safer injection supplies.

### Drug User's Union
Every third Saturday of the month, we support and invite our participants to come to the Drug User's union, where we discuss the local ways our criminal “justice” system fails us and hurts us. We work together to organize around a local campaign we all care about; individually we might feel powerless, but with the power of the people coming together, change can happen!
