## Calender
We currently distribute opioid overdose reversal kits every Saturday at Court Square Park in downtown Memphis, at the picnic held by our partner organization Food Not Bombs Memphis. We set up at 1:30, and leave around 3. 

Additionally, we aim to have a syringe service program in operation by fall of 2025. The dates and location for this program are not yet known.
