Welcome to 901 Harm Reduction! We're a public health collective providing mutual aid to marginalized folks in Memphis affected by the overdose crisis.

<!-- TODO: add amazon wishlist page -->

The overdose crisis and the war on people who use drugs are taking a terrible toll on our friends and neighbors. Unsafe equipment, supplies, police harassment and distrust are the norm, and lethally precarious situations are all too common. We are helping to reduce the danger this environment poses to our community through distribution of sterile equipment and community support.
